        The medieval and Renaissance periods witnessed significant advancements in automata, marked by the ingenious mechanical inventions
        of Al-Jazari during the Islamic Golden Age and visionary designs by Leonardo da Vinci in Renaissance Europe.
      </p>

      <h2>A. Ismail al-Jazari (1206, Islamic Golden Age)</h2>

      <p>
        Al-Jazari, a polymath and mechanical engineer from the Artuqid dynasty, authored <em>The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices</em> (1206),
        an extensive treatise detailing 50 mechanical devices, including sophisticated water clocks, musical automatons, and programmable machines using cams and pegs.
		His work synthesized prior knowledge, especially drawing upon earlier Islamic engineers such as the Banū Mūsā brothers, who had pioneered automatic 
		controls and pneumatic mechanisms in their Book of Ingenious Devices (850 CE). Al-Jazari's contributions notably advanced mechanical 
		engineering with the introduction of components such as:
		<ul>
        <li>Camshafts: Used to transform rotary into reciprocating motion, integral in his automata and water-raising machines.</li>
        <li>Crankshafts and crank-slider mechanisms: His twin-cylinder pump incorporated a crankshaft connecting rod mechanism,
		an innovation critical for converting continuous rotary motion into linear reciprocating movement, 
		prefiguring modern engine mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      </figure>

       <p>
        Al-Jazari's automata often employed water-driven systems, combining gears, valves, hydraulics, and 
		weights to perform complex motions, such as automated musicians playing instruments or water clocks 
		that used rolling bronze balls to mark time intervals. His devices represented a fusion of artistic 
		refinement and technical precision, serving both utilitarian and entertainment functions. Scholars 
		like Donald Hill have underscored that no other document from any cultural tradition before modern 
		times offers such comprehensive guidance on the manufacturing and design of machines, underlining 
		Al-Jazari's pivotal role in the history of robotics and automation.

      <h2>B. Leonardo da Vinci (1495)</h2>
      <p>
        In the late 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci designed a humanoid <em>robot knight</em> capable of sitting, waving its arms,
        and moving its jaw using a series of pulleys and gears. Though it was never built in his lifetime, the design embodied
        Renaissance ideals by combining anatomy, mechanics, and artistic vision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leonardo’s mechanical knight marked a shift from water-powered devices to more advanced gear-based motion systems,
        foreshadowing modern robotic engineering.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Together, the works of Al-Jazari and Leonardo represent a bridge between cultures and centuries, demonstrating the continuity
        of automata development from the Islamic world to Renaissance Europe, and laying groundwork for future innovations in robotics.
