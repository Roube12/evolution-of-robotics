      <h2>A. Mythological and Conceptual Roots</h2>
      <p>
        Greek mythology featured mechanical beings like <strong>Talos</strong>, a giant bronze protector.
        The story of Talos describes him as a massive, bronze automaton created to protect the island of Crete.
        Various accounts attribute his creation to the god Hephaestus or regard him as a survivor of an ancient bronze race.
        Talos would patrol Crete, warding off invaders by throwing boulders or heating himself and embracing enemies,
        reflecting early imaginative concepts of artificial beings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early concepts of artificial life reflected human fascination with creating lifelike machines.
        Greek myths, including those about Talos and other automata, highlight long-standing human interest in constructing
        machines that emulate living creatures. Ancient inventors and storytellers envisioned mechanical men, animals,
        and even self-moving statues—an obsession that symbolized a desire to comprehend and replicate life itself.
        This fascination continued through stories of inventors like Daedalus and the legendary automata attributed
        to deities and craftsmen.

      <h2>B. Ancient Automata</h2>
      <p><strong>Automata</strong> (singular: automaton) are abstract, mathematical models of machines or systems that follow
        a predetermined sequence of operations or transitions, usually in response to external inputs.</p>

      <h3>Archytas of Tarentum (4th century BCE)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="archytas_bust.jpg" alt="Bust believed to be Archytas" class="consistent-height">
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Bust from Villa of the Papyri, once identified as Archytas.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Archytas, a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and statesman from the 4th century BCE,
        is credited with designing one of the earliest known self-propelled flying devices —
        a wooden bird often called <strong>The Pigeon</strong>.
		This mechanical bird was powered by steam pressure and could reportedly fly about 200 
		meters, making it not only a primitive flying machine but also one of the earliest 
		examples of robotics and controlled flight experimentation. .
      </p>

        <img src="steam_pigeon.jpg" alt="Steam-powered pigeon of Archytas" class="consistent-height">
        <figcaption>Figure 3: The Steam-Powered Pigeon, one of the first flight experiments in robotics history.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Archytas’s invention utilized the principle that would later be formalized as Newton’s third law of motion,
        generating thrust by expelling steam backward to propel the bird forward, effectively making it an ancient prototype
        of rocket propulsion. Though exact designs remain 
		speculative, historical descriptions suggest the bird might have been suspended on 
		a pivot or wire for stability during flight
      </p>

      <p>
        Archytas’s work laid foundational concepts in mechanical engineering and demonstrated an early scientific approach
        to studying flight, possibly inspiring the development of automata and mechanical devices for entertainment
        and religious purposes in later periods.
      </p>

      <h3>Hero of Alexandria (1st century CE)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="hero_illustration.jpg" alt="Depiction of Hero of Alexandria" class="consistent-height">
        <figcaption>Figure 4: A 17th-century depiction of Hero of Alexandria.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Hero of Alexandria was a prolific inventor and engineer active in the 1st century CE who extensively documented
        mechanical devices powered by steam, air, or water in his work <em>Pneumatica</em>. Among his notable inventions 
		was the <em>aeolipile</em>, a steam-powered rotating sphere often considered the first known steam engine. This device 
		demonstrated conversion of steam pressure into rotational movement, paving the way for future steam-powered machinery.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="aeolipile_diagram.jpg" alt="Illustration of Hero's aeolipile" class="consistent-height">
        <figcaption>Figure 5: An illustration of Hero's aeolipile, the earliest known steam engine.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Hero also developed various programmable automatons, including temple doors that opened automatically, and 
		theatrical puppet shows with moving mechanical figures. These devices operated using principles of siphons, 
		weights, and pressure-based systems to create lifelike movements and effects, blending engineering with 
		theatrical spectacle and religious ritual. His designs served as precursors to later automation technologies 
		and highlighted the advanced understanding of pneumatics and mechanics possessed by ancient engineers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, Archytas and Hero of Alexandria represent pioneering figures in the history of automata, integrating early 
		mechanical and pneumatic principles that prefigured modern robotics and engineering. Their inventions illustrate 
		how ancient cultures explored automation not only as entertainment or religious devices but as demonstrations of 
		scientific principles and technological innovation.
