      <p>
        Modern robotics continues to evolve rapidly, driven by innovations in materials, design, AI, and human-machine interfaces, leading to transformative applications and raising important ethical considerations.
      </p>

      <h2>A. Soft Robotics</h2>
      <p>
        Soft robotics uses elastic materials to interact with humans and navigate complex environments. These robots offer comfort and adaptability in healthcare, wearable devices, and rehabilitation. Advanced fabrication techniques allow for multifunctional soft robots tailored to medical needs.
      </p>
      
      <h2>B. Swarm and Bio-Inspired Robotics</h2>
      <p>
        Swarm robotics, inspired by nature, involves multiple robots coordinating locally to achieve complex group behavior. Bio-inspired robots mimic animals for efficiency and adaptability, especially useful in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and exploration.
      </p>
     
      <h2>C. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)</h2>
      <p>
        BCIs create direct communication between the brain and robotic devices. This allows control of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive tools through neural signals, aiding individuals with impairments and enhancing independence.
      </p>
      
      <h2>D. Ethical and Societal Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        As robotics and AI become more capable, issues like automation-driven job loss, AI bias, and robot rights emerge. Ethical guidelines and policies aim to ensure robots benefit society while protecting human dignity and values.
