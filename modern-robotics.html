      <p>
        The 20th century marked the emergence of modern robotics as a distinct field, characterized by new terminology,
        theoretical foundations, and practical implementations.
      </p>

      <h2>A. Term “Robot” Introduced (1920)</h2>
      <p>
        The word "robot" was coined by Czech writer <strong>Karel Čapek</strong> in his 1920 play <em>R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)</em>.
        The term derives from the Czech word <em>robota</em>, meaning forced labor or drudgery. Čapek’s play popularized
        the idea of artificial beings created to serve humans, laying a conceptual foundation for robotics as we understand it today.

      <h2>B. Isaac Asimov</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1940s, science fiction author <strong>Isaac Asimov</strong> was credited by the Oxford English Dictionary for first using the term <em>robotics</em>.
        He proposed the famous <strong>Three Laws of Robotics</strong>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Robots must never harm human beings.</li>
        <li>Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1.</li>
        <li>Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>C. Cybernetics and Control Theory</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1940s and 1950s, American mathematician <strong>Norbert Wiener</strong> established the field of <strong>cybernetics</strong>
        — the study of control and communication in animals, humans, and machines. He introduced the concept of feedback loops,
        where systems self-regulate using output as input to maintain stability or enhance performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiener’s 1948 book <em>Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</em> formalized these ideas,
        which had major impacts on robotics, AI, neuroscience, and systems engineering.

      <h2>D. Unimate (1956)</h2>
      <p>
        The first practical industrial robot, <strong>Unimate</strong>, was developed by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger in 1956.
        It was an electro-mechanical robotic arm designed for factory automation tasks like die-casting and welding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unimate was installed at a General Motors plant in 1961 and became the first robot to perform repetitive tasks in
        manufacturing, launching the era of industrial robotics.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        These key milestones—Čapek’s introduction of the word “robot,” Asimov’s conceptual laws, Wiener’s cybernetics,
        and Unimate’s real-world implementation—together define the birth of modern robotics as a fusion of concept,
        theory, and engineering innovation.
