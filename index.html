      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Long before robots became a part of our daily lives, people were already dreaming about them. In ancient times,
        stories were told about mechanical creatures that could walk, talk, or serve their masters. These ideas might have
        sounded magical back then, but they planted the seeds for the robots we see today.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you will explore how robotics began and how it has changed through the centuries. You will learn
        about inventors from ancient Greece and the Islamic Golden Age, creative thinkers from the Renaissance, and the
        pioneers of modern robotics. From water-powered machines to smart robots that use artificial intelligence, the journey
        of robotics is full of surprising milestones and amazing breakthroughs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the history of robotics helps us appreciate how much has been achieved and how far we can still go. As you
        read, you will discover how imagination, science, and technology came together to shape the world of robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s begin our journey through the past to understand how robots came to life and how they continue to shape our future.
